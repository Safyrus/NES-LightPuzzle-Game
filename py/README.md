# Level Editor

There is a level editor (kind of) on a google spreadsheet availible here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-f22IFjEkOSLessQoJoMu5XGVv7Zm9MYwBfbggfWwEA/edit?usp=sharing

If you want to import your level into the game:
- download the spreadsheet as CSV
- run the python script as `python level.csv output.asm`
- add the code to the game
